# APPS40: Consolidating Infrastructure with Azure Kubernetes Service

![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-APPS-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)

## Session Abstract

Kubernetes is the open source container orchestration system that supercharges applications with scaling and reliability and unlocks advanced features, like A/B testing, Blue/Green deployments, canary builds, and dead-simple rollbacks.

In this session, youâ€™ll see how Tailwind Traders took a containerized application and deployed it to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Youâ€™ll walk away with a deep understanding of major Kubernetes concepts and how to put it all to use with industry standard tooling.

In order to deploy this template, you need an Azure Service Principal. If needed, use the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command to create the service principal. See [az ad sp create-for-rbac](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/sp?WT.mc_id=devops-0000-jessde&view=azure-cli-latest#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) for more information.

## Provider registration

The Tailwind Traders application uses many Azure services. In some cases, if a service has not yet been used in your subscription, a provider registration may be needed. The following commands will ensure your subscription is capable of running the Tailwind Traders application.

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Network
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DocumentDB
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationsManagement
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Sql
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerRegistry
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.insights
az feature register --name AvailabilityZonePreview --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
az feature register --name AKSAzureStandardLoadBalancer --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
az feature register --name VMSSPreview --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```

Then refresh you account with

```
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```

You will also need kubectl version 1.14.6

## Connect to deployment

To validate that the deployment has completed, select the Azure Container Instance.

![alt text](./images/aci.jpg)

Select **Containers**. Once the container state has changed from **Running** to **Terminated**, the deployment automation has completed.

![alt text](./images/logs.jpg)

Scroll to the bottom of the logs to retrieve both the application URL and the command needed to connect to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Running scale demo

> ðŸ’¡ You must have completed the [deployment](#provider-registration) before attempting to do the demo.

To run the scaling demo you need to add the publisher

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-publish
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: rabbitmq-client
        image: jeffhollan/rabbitmq-client:dev
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        command: ["send",  "amqp://user:PASSWORD@rabbitmq.default.svc.cluster.local:5672", "300"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
EOF
```

In two new terminals you need to have the following commands running to watch the results.

```
kubectl get hpa -w
```

![alt text](./images/hpa.png)

In the image above you can see that the application is scaling using the metrics from the horizontal pod autoscaler

```
kubectl get pods -o wide -w
```

![alt text](./images/pods.png)

In the image above you can see that we are scaling the pods to virtual node on ACI dynamically.

To cleanup the scaling demo use the following

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl delete -f -
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-publish
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: rabbitmq-client
        image: jeffhollan/rabbitmq-client:dev
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        command: ["send",  "amqp://user:PASSWORD@rabbitmq.default.svc.cluster.local:5672", "300"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
EOF
```

## Network policy

> ðŸ’¡ You must have completed the [deployment](#provider-registration) before attempting to do the demo.

For the networking policy demo we will need to open two terminals. The first we will pretend to be a rouge service in the default namespace.
The second we will apply the network policy.

In the first terminal issue the following commands

```
kubectl run --rm -it --image=alpine network-policy  --generator=run-pod/v1
```

Once you have the shell inside the cluster issue

```
wget http://stock.twt
```

Now exit this terminal with `exit`.

This will show that we are able to hit backend services in twt from any namespace as the network by default is flat.
Now in the second terminal we need to apply a network policy that will not allow any traffic from outside the twt namespace to hit it.

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: twt-policy
  namespace: twt
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          purpose: prod-app
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: twt-app
EOF
```

now in the first terminal enter

```
kubectl run --rm -it --image=alpine network-policy  --generator=run-pod/v1
```

Once you have the shell enter

```
wget --timeout=2 http://stock.twt
```

The connection should be blocked. Exit the terminal with `exit`

Now cleanup

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl delete -f -
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: twt-policy
  namespace: twt
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          purpose: prod-app
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: twt-ap
EOF
```

## Availability zones

> ðŸ’¡ You must have completed the [deployment](#provider-registration) before attempting to do the demo.

This is set up by the [deployment.json](deployment.json)
To test this is set up correctly use the following command

```
kubectl describe nodes | grep -e "Name:" -e "failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone"
```

The output should look like

```
Name:               aks-agentpool-12493275-vmss000000
                    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=southeastasia-1
Name:               aks-agentpool-12493275-vmss000001
                    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=southeastasia-2
Name:               aks-agentpool-12493275-vmss000002
                    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=southeastasia-3
Name:               virtual-node-aci-linux
```

## Delete your deployment

To delete the deployment run the following:

```
az group delete -n < your resource group> -y
```
